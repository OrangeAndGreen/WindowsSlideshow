DEV NOTES:

History:
	Keep a list of previous images

	i.e.
	0: ImD
	1: ImC
	2: ImB
	3: ImA

	Always add newest image at start of list, then crop list to maxLength if needed

	Use mHistoryIndex to go back in history:
		During normal run, mHistoryIndex == -1
		When user presses back, we increment the index (0, 1, 2, 3, ...)

		Now when showing an image:
			If(mHistoryIndex < 0)
				Show new image and update history
			Else
				Show image at index, derement index, don't update history

	So we have the direction and mHistoryIndex:
										histIndex	Show From
		direction < 0 && index < 0:		++			History
		direction = 0 && index < 0:		0			?
		direction > 0 && index < 0:		0			New
		direction < 0 && index >= 0:	++			History
		direction = 0 && index >= 0:	0			?
		direction > 0 && index >= 0:	--			New/History
